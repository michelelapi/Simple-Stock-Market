### 2. Solution
In most projects I managed, related to web applications, I always used the same three-layer architecture (front-end, business, data source).
In this case, since there are no requirements for the UI and the structure of the back-end,
I limited myself to create a simple standalone application using J2SE.

With regard to the back-end I created a singleton class to access the business functionality.
For the datasource, as required in the test, I memorized all the information in memory in a HashMap (for faster searching) using as the key hashcode returned by the two classes Stock and Trade (representing a stock and a trade).

I used J2SE 1.8 to use functional programming in the business logic.

I used Maven to help the user to run the application start-up in the IDE (Eclipse in this case).
